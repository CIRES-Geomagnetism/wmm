### Description of the WMM magnetic components

#### Magnetic values

- **‘dec’ - Declination (deg)** Angle between the horizontal magnetic field vector and true north, positive east, measured in degrees.
- **‘inc’ - Inclination (deg)**: The angle made by the Earth's magnetic field with the horizontal plane, positive down, measured in degrees.
- **‘h’ - H (nT)**: Horizontal intensity of the Earth's magnetic field, measured in nanoteslas (nT).
- **‘x’- X (nT)**: Northward component of the Earth's magnetic field, measured in nanoteslas (nT).
- **‘y’ - Y (nT)**: Eastward component of the Earth's magnetic field, measured in nanoteslas (nT).
- **‘z’ - Z (nT)**: Downward component of the Earth's magnetic field, measured in nanoteslas (nT).
- **'f' - F (nT)**: Total intensity of the Earth's magnetic field, measured in nanoteslas (nT).
